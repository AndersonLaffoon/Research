            <p><i>ENIAC</i>, or Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, was the first programmable general-use computer. It was built during World War II by the United States. At the Moore School of Electronic Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, physicist John Mauchly, engineer J. Presper Eckert, Jr., and their colleagues led a project to build an all-electric computer. It was funded by the government. Work began in 1943 under contract to the army, under director Herman Goldstine. Within the next year, mathematician John von Neumann began to work with the group.</p>
            <p>It was designed for computing values for artillery range tables, but it lacked some of the characteristics that computers have today. It used plugboards for communication to the machine, which meant that once instructions were programmed, the machine ran at electronic speed. However, it took days to rewire the machine for each new task. Even though it took so long to program it, it was the most powerful calculating device built up to that point in time. Even though <i>ENIAC</i> was built for a specific purpose, it could execute different instructions or alter the execution of instructions based on the value of some data. This meant that it could be used for a wider range of problems.</p>
            <p><i>ENIAC</i> was very large. It took up a space of 50 ft by 30 ft in the basement of the Moore School. It had 40 U-shaped panels along three walls. Each panel was 2 ft by 2 ft by 8 ft. It had 17,000 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitators, 6,000 switches, and 1,500 relays. It ran continuously, generating 174 kilowatts of heat, which meant that it needed its own air conditioning unit. It executed up to 5,000 additions per second, which was way faster than machines before.</p>
